# This repo provide a Python script dedicated to studying the basic physics behind the space-charge effect, that is, Coulomb's Law.

In an ion trap device, oscillating electric fields (RF) in the rods create a "potential well" in the center.
Positive ions "roll" to the bottom of this well and become trapped there. When there are few ions, the average distance between them (r in Coulomb's Law) is large.
The repulsive force between them is negligible compared to the strong confining field force of the instrument.
The ions occupy an ideal, small space in the center of the analyzer (Figure 9, left panel).
Coulomb's Law states that the repulsive force between two equal charges (such as two positive ions being analyzed) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them (1/r²).
This means that if you force many ions to get very close together, the force with which they push each other increases exponentially.
Thus, the greater the number of positively charged ions in the trap, the more difficult it is to keep them far enough apart to avoid electrostatic repulsion, and therefore the more difficult it is to control their trajectories.
When the concentration of ions in the trap becomes very high, the collective term of Coulomb repulsion forces between all the ions becomes significant.
The ion cloud creates its own internal electric field that opposes the confining field of the instrument.
The ions push each other away from the ideal center, expanding the ion cloud.
